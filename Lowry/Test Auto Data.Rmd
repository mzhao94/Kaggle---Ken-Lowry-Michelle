```{r}
library(ISLR)
lm.fit = lm(Auto$mpg ~ year, data = Auto)
plot(lm.fit)
plot(line(Auto$year, Auto$mpg))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
